GIVEN string called infix, it contains either uppercase alphabets and 4  kinds of operators(+,-,*,/). You need to convert the string into its postfix (RPN) form.
Algorithm:
Maintain priority table:
*,/ --> 3
+,- --> 2
operands --> 1
Step1: Take a string of same length and call it as postfix.
Step2: Take a stack of characters and take top and set it to -1 (st[], top = -1)
Step3: Take 2 variables i to run of input infix string j to run on output postfix string and set both to 0.
Step4: Start running a loop on given input string
	if infix[i] is an operand:
		put it in the output string
	else:
		As long as top != -1 and
		priority(infix[i]) <= priority(infix[i])
			Keep on popping the element from stack and insert the output string

		Push current character (infix[i]) into the stack
Step5: If there are any operators left over in the stack directly bring them to the output string from top to bottom
